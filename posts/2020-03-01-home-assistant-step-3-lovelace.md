Home Assistant recently came out with their new UI in January. A ui called Lovelace it has now become their default ui interface. Taking a new approach for building user interfaces for Home Assistant.

Note! I had to cut this project short because of the timeframe for my new job, but here is a quick overview over my custom Lovelace UI which i was able to put together.

A dynamic UI with a whole new set of features:

- 24 card grid.
- A UI editor.
- Faster!
- And fully customizable
  - Cards have a list of attributes and options which can alter how your data is presented.
  - Themes!
  - Entity overriding privileges (name and icon).
  - Custom cards built from the HA community.

This is whats so fun about this new platform is that the community is blooming. Make HA work for you!

Take a look at my UI in mobile view:
