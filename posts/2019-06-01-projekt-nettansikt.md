So, i've chosen to start blogging my experiences/insights/thoughts as a developer. Both to learn and to share knowledge.

Trying to find the right platform to start a blog was my biggest challenge.

Google didn't make in much easier, i have a feeling their algorithm favorites something called **WORDPRESS**. So i tested it out.

Making it through the first configuration, then the second configuration, then they wanted me to pay them for a domain name i already have.

At last i made it through to the end, and i was left with was a revamped version of Joomla.

Using Wordpress, there is almost no challenge, and you end up paying for something in end anyway, something i'm *_not_* interested in.

I wanted the right platform, for a simple programming blog and portfolio for my future projects.

This was until i stumbled into the best place on the internet; *Reddit*, and found a post about **Jekyll**.

*For those who does not know what Jekyll is:*

>*Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license*

This lightweight, easy to use, multilingual system is a perfect substitution for platforms similar to Wordpress.

Using Jekyll you can get *FREE* hosting through Github!
